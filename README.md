# C-language-practise

Being a freshman in AHU and majoring in computer science, I just would like to share my experience with other peers and of course I would like to recieve requests from masters which would definitely help me a lot.
Now we have finished the basic study of C language, and our text book is the red book written by Tan and I believe many chinese unversities would like to chose this book for thier first year students,although the book sucks!
So these are my codes basically covering all the exercises after each chapter, if you are a newbie who also feel so confused about the C language and the coding world, you can check my codes and find some useful inspirations!And if you are a master for C language and you got plenty of leisure times, you can also check my codes and try to find some bugs in it.I would like to recieve feedbacks from you all!
